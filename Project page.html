								Overview:
							</h2>
							<p>
								This project idea proposes to develop a True Random Number Generator (herein referred to as the TRNG), with a probability ratio of 1:1 for any value in the range.</p>
							<p>
								Random numbers are essential in modern cryptography for creating strong encryption keys. Most current on system methods of generating random numbers are considered sudo-random. The most common techniques use linear mathematical formulae, originating from a common set of seed variables. As the values are not truly random but deterministic, it is theoretically possible for an attacker to predict future numbers, and in doing so break the encryption.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is proposed to develop a TRNG, leveraging the decay characteristics of a radioisotope. This truly random seed data, combined with further mathematical manipulation to eliminate the Gaussian distribution will produce a truly random number stream.

								Motiviation:
							</h2>
							<p>
								This project has the potential to meet a need currently present within the IT sector, assisting in providing consistent and reliable raw input for the encryption algorithms of today and the future.
							</p>
							<p>
								Digital security impacts all sectors of the modern world. From individual rights to global finances, breeches in data security present a major threat. Combatting these threats presents an opportunity to contribute to the greater good by strengthening data encryption at all levels, thereby reducing incidence of data breeches and the costs associated to them, financial or otherwise.

							<p>
								Developing a product which provides system builders with a TRNG at a low cost and in a modular, replaceable package presents an opportunity to improve digital security for all <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/notifiable-data-breaches/notifiable-data-breaches-statistics/notifiable-data-breaches-scheme-12month-insights-report" target="_blank">Australian Information Commisioner 2019</a>

								Description:

							<h3>In this project, it is proposed to further develop the radioisotope decay technique.</h3>
							<p>
								The decay characteristics of radioisotopes are well known. For any given volume of an isotope, half of the atoms will undergo radioactive decay in a given period. This is known as the half-life of the isotope and cannot be altered by any external influence. Despite the decay rate being highly predictable over time, individual decay events occur are at random. This behaviour can be leveraged to produce a highly random sample set.
							</p>
							<h4>This project concept incorporates two major areas;</h4>
							<h5>
								The capture of seed data from the decay of a radio isotope, which is predominantly a hardware challenge. Challenges include;
							</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>Selection of a radioisotope with suitable properties. Half-life, activity, volume, and user safety are major considerations.</li>
								<li>Sample capture hardware development.</li>
								<li>The interface between hardware and software.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The intention with this project is to simplify and miniaturise the prototype demonstrated by <a href="https://hackaday.com/2015/08/16/hackaday-prize-entry-nuclear-powered-random-number-generator/" target="_blank">M.daSilva (Hackaday 2022)</a> , resulting in a final product which fits within standard form factors and communication protocols. A single module of either 2.5” HDD, or PCIE 8x dimensions, will allow the device to be added to any modern computer system, from home users to data centres.
							</p>
							<p>
								The selected radioisotope will be mounted in a shielded housing to mitigate risks associated with radiation. Each decay event will be detected with a Geiger-muller tube, an electrical component that detects the ionising particles produced by radioactive decay and outputs a corresponding electrical signal. Coupled with a microcontroller to collect the sample, this will provide the seed data required for the TRNG.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The manipulation of the sample data to produce a true random number.
							</h5>
							<p>
								A TRNG should produce values with extremely high entropy, meaning no single value should have a higher probability of occurring than any other <a href="http://math.bu.edu/individual/murad/stable-contents.pdf" target="_blank">(Samoradnitsky 2017).</a> 
							</p>
							<p>
								While the values captured from radioisotope decay are random, the distribution of samples is highly predictable. The likelihood of a single value occurring is higher the closer that value is to the average of several samples. This phenomenon is known as a Gaussian distribution. To reduce the statistical probability for any given value, additional manipulation of the value is required. This process is generally known as a “Randomness Extractor”, and there is a large volume of prior work done in this space. For this project it is proposed to combine the seed data with well know mathematical formulae to output a stream of truly random numbers <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6670761" target="_blank">(Berta, Fawzi et al. 2014).</a>

						<h4>
							Initial prototyping will be conducted with
						</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclide-basics-americium-241" target="_blank">A radioisotope, typically Americium-241.</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3?selectedStore=us" target="_blank">An Arduino microcontroller</a></li>

							<li>Breadboards and general circuitry components.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>
							Further hardware development will include.
						</h4>
						<li>Developing and printing custom PCB to integrate the circuits</li>
						<li>Programming a stand-alone microcontroller to replace the Arduino module</li>
					</ul>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						The Arduino and stand-alone microcontroller can be programmed in the C++ language. The Arduino platform provides an IDE <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank">(Arduino 2022)</a>, which includes a text editor, terminal, and other functionality to assist with writing code. This IDE will also compile machine code for several standalone microcontrollers. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Host system drivers and software will be developed in the most suitable language available, with requirements to be determined once development begins.
					</p>
					<p>
						PCB design will be undertaken with software such as EAGLE <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/features" target="_blank">(Autodesk 2022)</a>, which provides components libraries, trace routing and other design tools. There are a number of manufacturers available who will print small volumes of custom PCB designs from the Gerber files output by such design software.

						<h2>
							Outcome:
						</h2>
						<p>
							To be successful, this project should result in a self-contained TRNG, which can be installed in any modern PC or server.
						</p>
						<p>
							This product would enable a system builder to include a TRNG into any system, similar to installing a graphics card or additional storage drives. Due to the relatively simple nature of the product, retail cost should remain low compared to other system components which makes the product highly desirable to the target market. Providing this functionality as a replaceable component also removes the requirement for CPU manufacturers to include this capability within CPU designs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Easily available, on system true random number generation will increase the strength of encryption algorithms, leading to greater protection from attacks and the losses associated with data security breaches.
