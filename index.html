						<h2>Profile</h2>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/scooter.jpg" alt="" height="300" /></span>I grew up in Gippsland, Victoria, and have lived in small country towns my whole life. I started my working life on remote Western Australian cattle stations. During this time, I developed a love of building and fabrication, which led me to completing a boiler making trade and later supervision and inspection qualifications. I currently work in systems development for an engineering and NDT service provider.</p>
						<p>I have always loved knowing how things work, occasionally to excess. As a kid I was more likely to disassemble the lawnmower than mow the lawns!</p>
						<p>When not working I enjoy time with my wife and two children, hunting and metal, wood, and electronics projects.</p>

						<h2>Why IT?</h2>
						<p>I have always enjoyed building things, and this led me to want to understand how things work. I did not have a lot of exposure to computers or the IT field until taking an office role in 2018. The company had no local IT support, and I was working with large volumes of data using a niche piece of software. I developed a reputation for being “good with computers” amongst my team and was given responsibilities for managing and maintaining all the IT infrastructure, including end user support. I was also able to investigate solutions to several functional deficiencies in the software and systems being used. Since then, I have developed a SharePoint site with extensive automation which has become the model for similar projects around the world. I have also worked with the niche software supplier to make improvements to their product and am currently working to integrate this into the company’s wider digital environment.</p>
						<p>I chose to study at RMIT for several reasons. I intend to pursue a Bachelor’s degree, and the course content looks to give detailed, but wide ranging coverage of the field. The 100% online delivery is also essential to my situation, as attending on premises is not possible given my location, family, and work commitments. The reputation of RMIT is also excellent, with the institution held in high regard by past students and industry.</p>
						<p>Upon completion of the bachelor’s degree I am confident I will have a solid general IT skillset, and have gained fundamental knowledge in a broad range of IT specialities. While I come to this course with some self-learned skills, a structured and proven curriculum will bridge gaps in my experience. Exposure to ideas, concepts, and the tertiary thought process will be valuable skills as I continue to develop as an IT professional.</p>

							<h1>My ideal job</h1>
							<h3>Data engineer - CSIRO Data61</h3>
							<p>This position is a data engineer working for CSIRO, the Australian national science agency. The role is responsible for providing access to information and predictions extracted from the available data. Users include researchers, industry, and general public, delivered through a variety of pathways. The ability to work with the country’s leading researchers, developing new technologies and insights fits with my passions. As a dedicated research institution, the CSIRO presents an opportunity to be involved with a range of exiting projects.</p>
							<p>The required skills describe the ability to extract information and predictions from data and deliver to cloud platforms as needed by users. There is a strong emphasis on machine learning and cloud computing, software development as well as generalised critical thinking skills. As the role is part of a large and highly diverse team, the ability to operate effectively in this environment is also essential. The advertisement specifies a relevant tertiary qualification or equivalent experience in software engineering is needed to be considered as an applicant.</p>
							<p>I currently have experience working on highly technical projects across a wide variety of disciplines, often with competing priorities. I have developed and managed operational environments and have some exposure to cloud platforms and the needs of managing and maintaining them effectively. My software engineering experience is limited to small, unmanaged, limited exposure developments.</p>
							<p>To develop the capabilities required to successfully pursue this role, I will complete a bachelor’s degree in IT with RMIT, with a focus on programming and cloud platforms. I will then undertake further study in computer science specialities, predominately machine learning and AI. With the required knowledge, I will seek roles that allow me to implement the skills I have gained. This will give me the skill set, and the practical experience required to effectively contribute in this or similar positions.</p>

							<h3>
								The Logician
							</h3>
							<p>
								Logicians pride themselves on their unique perspectives and vigorous intellect. They can’t help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe – which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been Logicians. This personality type is fairly rare, but with their creativity and inventiveness, Logicians aren’t afraid to stand out from the crowd.</p>

							<h3>What these results say about my style</h3>
							<p>
								These results suggest a critical thinker and problem solver, however they imply a weakness in areas of interpersonal relationship management and goal orientation. Based solely on the test findings, I would be a good member of teams working on solving technical problems but would struggle in environments where human and societal factors were a major component. A successful team requires a range of personality types. To compliment this suggested style, a team including members with high levels of emotional intuition and outcome focus is required.
