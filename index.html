						<h2>Profile</h2>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/scooter.jpg" alt="" height="300" /></span>I grew up in Gippsland, Victoria, and have lived in small country towns my whole life. I started my working life on remote Western Australian cattle stations, an environment where my natural ingenuity and determination flourished. During this time, I developed a passion for building and fabrication, which led me to completing a boiler making trade, predominantly in the offshore Oil and Gas sector. I then successful pursued supervision and inspection qualifications related to my trade. My current career involves asset integrity inspection, and systems development for an engineering and NDT service provider.</p>
						<p>I have always been intrigued by the intricacies of how things work, occasionally to excess. As a kid I was more likely to disassemble the lawnmower than mow the lawns!</p>
						<p>When not working I enjoy time with my wife and two children, and our two cats and dogs. Some of my hobbies include hunting, motorbike riding, metal, wood, and electronics projects.</p>

						<h2>Why IT?</h2>
						<p>I have always enjoyed creating things, which has led me to a passion for understanding the mechanics and intricacies of things. Prior to 2018 my exposure to computers and IT was very limited due to my occupation. In 2018 I began a new chapter in my career, taking on the position of operations support technician with a new company. The company had no local IT support, and as part of the role I was working with large volumes of data using a specialist piece of software. I developed a reputation for being “good with computers” amongst my team and was assigned responsibilities for managing and maintaining all the IT infrastructure, including end user support. I was also able to explore solutions to several functional deficiencies in the software and systems being utilized. Since then I have developed a SharePoint site with extensive automation which has become the model for similar projects around the world. I have also worked with software suppliers to make improvements to their products and am currently working to integrate these improvements into the company’s wider digital environment.</p>
						<p>This exposure triggered my innate desire to grow and develop new skills, with IT providing a vast array of opportunities to improve the world around me.</p>
						<p>I chose to study at RMIT due to the reputation for delivering exceptional course content coupled with the flexible delivery method, which positions this university as a leader in the sector. I intend to further my education and pursue a Bachelor’s degree. Within this courses content there is detailed, but wide-ranging coverage of the field. The 100% online delivery is also essential to my situation as attending on premises is not possible given my location, family, and work commitments. </p>
						<p>Upon completion of the bachelor’s degree I am confident I will have a solid general IT skillset, and have gained fundamental knowledge in a broad range of IT specialities. While I come to this course with some self-learned skills, a structured and proven curriculum will bridge gaps in my experience. Exposure to ideas, concepts, and the tertiary thought process will be valuable skills as I continue to develop as an IT professional.</p>

							<h3>
								The Logician
							</h3>
							<p>
								Logicians pride themselves on their unique perspectives and vigorous intellect. They can’t help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe – which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been Logicians. This personality type is fairly rare, but with their creativity and inventiveness, Logicians aren’t afraid to stand out from the crowd.</p>

							<h3>What these results say about my style</h3>
							<p>
								The results of the above tests appear to be highly contradictory, with some comparable attributes positioned at opposite ends of the range depending on the specific test. Collectively, these results imply a personality with an aptitude for creativity and invention, and deficiencies in decisiveness. 
							</p>
							<p>
								From the perspective of a potential employer, the results suggest a personality well suited to positions where problem solving, and product development are the primary focus. It is implied that I may not be a good fit for managerial or customer centric roles. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I have a preference to be involved in the detail of any project, which fits with my implied and actual strengths. Throughout my professional career, I have been part of a large variety of teams. I have a track record of successfully joining and contributing to existing teams, communicating, and collaborating with stakeholders effectively. I have demonstrated capacity for leadership when required, however this is not a position I am naturally inclined to seek out.
